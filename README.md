#### Mapping of U.S. National Drug Codes (NDC) to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Level 4 classes
###### codename: ndc_map
  
This script reads a file called _NDC_MASTER_INFO.csv_ with the following columns:  
**"YEAR", "MONTH", "NDC"**  
and outputs a file called _ndc_atc_long_list.csv_ containing the following columns:  
**"YEAR", "MONTH", "NDC", "RXCUI", "ATC4"**  
as well as another file called atc_name.csv with the following columns:  
**"ATC4", "ATC4_NAME"**  

The script maps each NDC, according to the date it was used (year and month), to all its ATC-4 classes (if any is available) by querying the RxNav API at https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/. The algorithm uses parallelization and query caching to greatly improve efficiency. At my 8-cores desktop computer, I mapped 2.1 million YEAR-MONTH-NDC rows to 3.33 million YEAR-MONTH-NDC-RXCUI-ATC4 rows in 65 minutes.
